## For a fun web-based AR/VR experience on my [personal website]([aneall.github.io](https://aneall.github.io/)!

## Mobile Devices
~ Navigate to the url and you'll be able to utilize the translocational and rotational movement of your phone to 'walk around' in the experience!

## Desktops and Laptops
~ Navigate translocationally using your keys (WASD or arrow keys)
~ Navigate rotationally by dragging with your mouse or trackpad!

## AR and VR HMDs
~ Automatic detection of HMD usage will allow you to simply walk around (translocational movement) or rotate your head (rotational movement) in order to explore!
